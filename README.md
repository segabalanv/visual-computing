# visual-computing
Repository for files used at the Visual Computing course at the National University of Colombia. The course's intructor
is JP Charalambos (http://nakednous.github.io). Most of this repository consist of codes written in a language called
processing, which is a java-like language but with focus on making visual representations on the program as easy as
possible.
